## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-11

### Added
- Add new `track` command to download individual songs.
- Add `--genre` flag to fetch and embed genre information into file metadata tags.

### Fixed
- Handle empty media resources gracefully to prevent crashes.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-18

### Added
- Add new `artist` command to download an artist’s top tracks.
- Add `--limit` flag for the `artist` command to restrict the number of tracks.
- Add `--strict` flag for downloads: fail if the requested quality is unavailable.

### Changed
- Set default download quality to **MP3 320kbps**.

### Removed
- Remove `--quality=best` option. Fallback to lower quality is now the default behavior; use the `--strict` flag to prevent fallback.

### Fixed
- Handle error when `SNG_CONTRIBUTORS` metadata is empty.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-06-16

### Fixed
- Restore ability to download tracks without a Deezer Premium account (limited to **MP3 128kbps** for free accounts).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-19

### Added
- Support downloading full albums and playlists with more than 40 tracks (previous limit removed).
- Fetch and embed **BPM** and **musical key** into metadata tags.
- Add local **database system** (`tracks.db`) to track downloaded files and avoid re-downloading, even if files are renamed or moved.
- Improve CLI **output formatting** for a cleaner and more informative user experience.

### Changed
- Replace the `godeez` file in the user’s home directory with a `.godeez/` directory, which now stores both `config.toml` and `tracks.db`.  
👉 If upgrading, move your existing config into `.godeez/config.toml`.
- Simplify `config.toml`: remove the need for `iv` and `license_token`.
- Automatically delete corrupted or incomplete files on download failure.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-10-15

### Added

- Initial release of **GoDeez** with basic Deezer album and playlist downloading capabilities.

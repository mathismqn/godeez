## Features

* Download playlists, albums, artists' top tracks, and individual tracks from Deezer
* Organized tree structure: saves all music in `Artist/Album/Track` format for consistency
* Playlist M3U files: automatically creates playlist files with relative paths when downloading playlists
* Select audio quality: MP3 128kbps, MP3 320kbps (default), or FLAC (⚠️ non-premium accounts are limited to 128kbps)
* Automatically adds metadata tags to downloaded files
* Fetch and tag songs with BPM and musical key
* Smart skip system: avoids re-downloading already existing files using hashes and metadata
* Cross-platform support (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux)
* Simple and easy-to-use CLI

## Installation

To install **GoDeez**, simply download the latest binary for your platform from the Releases page.

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/mathismqn/godeez/releases) page.
2. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Move the binary to a directory included in $PATH for easy access (optional but recommended).

Example (Linux/macOS):
```bash
# Move the downloaded binary to /usr/local/bin for easy access from anywhere
mv godeez-1.2.0-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/godeez
```

## Configuration

The first time you run **GoDeez**, a configuration directory named `.godeez` will be automatically created in your home directory (`$HOME` on Linux/macOS, `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows).

Inside this directory:
- `config.toml`: main configuration file which contains several important variables that you need to fill out manually
- `tracks.db`: internal database used to track downloaded files and prevent duplicates

### Steps to configure

1. Run the application for the first time: this creates the `.godeez` directory and the `config.toml` file inside it.
2. Edit the `config.toml` file with a text editor to set the required values.

### Variables to configure

Here are the key variables you need to set in `config.toml`:

1. `arl_cookie`
* **What is it?**: The `arl_cookie` is a session cookie used for authentication with Deezer. Without this cookie, the downloader cannot access your account to retrieve playlists, albums, or songs.
* **How to retrieve it**:
	1.	Open your browser and log in to your Deezer account.
	2.	Open the Developer Tools (right-click on the page and select “Inspect” or press F12).
	3.	Navigate to the Application tab (in Chrome/Edge) or Storage tab (in Firefox).
	4.	In the left panel, look for Cookies and select `https://www.deezer.com`.
	5.	Find the arl cookie and copy its value.

2. `secret_key`
* **What is it?**: The `secret_key` is a cryptographic value used to decrypt Deezer’s media files.
* **How to retrieve it?**: While we cannot provide the specific secret_key in this documentation, it can be found online through various sources or developer communities that focus on Deezer.

3. `output_dir` (optional)
* **What is it?**: The `output_dir` is the path where downloaded music files will be saved.
* **Default**: If left empty, it defaults to `~/Music/GoDeez`.
* **Note**: Once set, it's recommended not to change it, as this may interfere with the skip system that relies on consistent file paths and hash indexing to detect already downloaded songs.

### Example

Here's an example of a minimal `config.toml` you can customize:
```toml
# ~/.godeez/config.toml

arl_cookie = 'your_arl_cookie_here'
secret_key = 'your_secret_key_here'
output_dir = ''  # optional
```

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the different download commands:

```bash
# Download an album (saved as: Artist/Album/Tracks)
godeez download album 12345678

# Download a playlist (songs distributed in tree + M3U file created)
godeez download playlist 87654321

# Download top tracks from an artist (saved as: Artist/Various Albums/Tracks)
godeez download artist 11223344 --limit 5

# Download a single track (saved as: Artist/Album/Track)
godeez download track 98765432

# Download with specific quality and BPM data
godeez download track 98765432 --quality flac --bpm
```

## File Organization

**GoDeez** organizes downloaded music in a predictable tree structure:

```
~/Music/GoDeez/
├── Artist 1/
│   ├── Album 1/
│   │   ├── 01. Track 1.mp3
│   │   └── 02. Track 2.mp3
│   └── Album 2/
│       ├── 01. Track 1.mp3
│       └── 02. Track 2.mp3
├── Artist 2/
│   └── Album 1/
│       ├── 01. Track 1.mp3
│       └── 02. Track 2.mp3
└── Playlists/
    └── My Playlist/
        └── My Playlist.m3u
```

### Key Features:
- **Consistent Structure**: All downloads (albums, artists, tracks, playlists) follow the same `Artist/Album/Track` organization
- **Smart Fallbacks**: If album information is missing, songs are placed in an "Unknown Album" folder
- **Playlist Files**: When downloading playlists, an M3U file is created in `Playlists/[Playlist Name]/` with relative paths to the distributed songs
- **Skip System Compatibility**: The existing skip system works seamlessly with the new structure using file hashes and metadata
